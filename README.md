# VRDL_HW1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This repository is the official implementation of My VRDL_HW1: Image classification


Requirements
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

pytorch:
    pip3 install torch==1.10.0+cu113 torchvision==0.11.1+cu113 torchaudio===0.10.0+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113/torch_stable.html

sklearn:
    pip3 install scikit-learn

PIL:
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade Pillow

matplotlib:
    pip3 install matplotlib








Training
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To train the models, run this command:

python3 train.py <path_to_data> 

    Then the the program would perform training and save the ten best models locally, from best_model0 to best_model9
    
    In the <path_to_data> you shall indicate the path to the directory that contains following files and directories:
            1. train(folder): contain all of the images for training
            2. test(folder): contain all of the images for testing
            3. classes.txt: contain all the labels
            4. testing_img_order.txt: contain the order of testing image coming in
            5. training_labels.txt: contain all the training image number aloing with their labels
    
    About train process, I specify the transform as:

	transform = torchvision.transforms.Compose([
		torchvision.transforms.Resize((300,300)),
		torchvision.transforms.RandomCrop((270,270)),	
		torchvision.transforms.ToTensor(),
		torchvision.transforms.Normalize(mean = [0.485,0.456,0.406], std = [0.229,0.224,0.225]),
		torchvision.transforms.RandomHorizontalFlip(),
		torchvision.transforms.RandomRotation(30)
	])
  with batch_size = 10, for more detailed explaination about the whole process, please refer to the code comment and report.
 
 Warning: You the data path shall not contain / or \ in the tail.

 	Correct: /data
 	Error: /data/
 
 If you mistype, then error would occur, this format is the same for all the path in this implementation.
  
 







Evaluation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
To evaluate my model on, run:

python3 inference.py <path_to_data> <path_to_model>
    
    <path_to_data> is the same as train part
    
    In the <path_to_model> you shall indicate the path to the directory that contains following files:
            1. All of the 10 models from best_model0 to best_model9
    
    To get the 10 models, go to the models/ directory in main branch 

After running, an answer.txt would be generated and stored locally.
    
Compress the answer.txt to .zip file and upload to codalab is enough to evaluate my model's prediction
    
For convinience, I write a checktxt.py to check if two answer.txt is the same
    
Run checktxt.py: python3 checktxt.py <path_to_first_answer> <path_to_second_answer>
    
    <path_to_first_answer> should be filled with the path to first answer.txt   ex: /answer1/answer.txt
    
    <path_to_second_answer> should be filled with the path to second answer.txt   ex: /answer2/answer.txt
    
    If Output is True, means the two answer.txt are exactly the same, in False case, they're not.







Pre-trained Models
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can download and use pretrained models by simply running this command in python3:
    
    model = torchvision.models.resnet50(pretrained = True)
    
    This will load a pretrained resnet50 to your model, and the resnet50 will be automatically downloaded if have not been downloaded yet.
    
    



Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Our model achieves the following performance on :
