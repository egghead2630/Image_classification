This repo is built up for my homework1 by 310552006 zychen, NYCU at 2021/11/3

It's welcomed to take my code and report as references, because I also take other source codes as my references.

However, Do NOT just COPY and PASTE my files as your homework, that's what called Plagiarism, and that's no benefit to you.

That's my announcement, thanks.
